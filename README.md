# missions_to_mars
In this assignment, you will build a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. The following outlines what you need to do.  ### Before You Begin  1. Create a new repository for this project called `web-scraping-challenge`. **Do not add this homework to an existing repository**.  2. Clone the new repository to your computer.  3. Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the web scraping challenge. Use a folder name to correspond to the challenge: **Missions_to_Mars**.  4. Add your notebook files to this folder as well as your flask app.  5. Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.  ## Step 1 - Scraping  Complete your initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.  * Create a Jupyter Notebook file called `mission_to_mars.ipynb` and use this to complete all of your scraping and analysis tasks. The following outlines what you need to scrape.  ### NASA Mars News  * Scrape the [NASA Mars News Site](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/) and collect the latest News Title and Paragraph Text. Assign the text to variables that you can reference later.
